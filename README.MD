My project is slightly different to what they wanted us to do. But it should cover all the requirements.

NOTE: I used pipenv for the python virtual environment

Here are some of the APIs you can go to.

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/menu/1
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/token/logout/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/token/login/
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api-token-auth
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/users

Please checkout the urls.py file to better understand urls. Basically, I kept mostly everything at the root and I was not verbose.

Also, everything I found unnecessary in the exercises, I didn't do
